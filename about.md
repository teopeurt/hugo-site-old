### Who Am I

Who I am is not really important as I want this to be a focus on my ideas, but to give some context, here goes..

I do data, I do software, I do open-source, I love building distibuted, connected services, hack embedded devices and tame "big data". I also write software for mobiles, and try to make Web services "reactive". I am also helping to build the open Web. I am a crypanalyst - but I won't divulge any of my clients.

One thing I do very well is SHIP PRODUCT. I got so good at cleaning up other people's mess I formed a company [PigStyCoders](http://pigstycoders.com). I don't do well with theories and think abstraction for abstraction sake is silly. I am a failed academic.

I love challenges, so please email me with your real-world software problems and I will try to fix it.

In my past life I used to work with software in high performance cars [here](http://www.astonmartin.com/), [here](http://www.jaguar.com/gb/en/) and [here](http://www.bmw.com/), racing cars [here](http://www.mclaren.com/home/), regular cars [here](http://www.ford.co.uk/), now I work with High Performance Computers. 

I tried to do something totally different in [Computational Finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance), realised that most of the theory was based on dodgy application of Physics, so decided to fund and do my own research into analysing risk and capital markets - similar in vein to [Mandelbroit](http://www.amazon.com/The-behavior-Markets-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0465043550). I am due to launch a product which demonstrates and blows Portfolio Theory out of the water. 

I am highly opinionated and think Africa's internet rate penetration/adoption is NOT going quick enough. I intend to change that hence why I support projects like the [Village Telco](http://villagetelco.org). Unfortunately the stumbling block is not technical.
