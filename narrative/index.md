Having the been to a few hackathons, I have witnessed the somewhat explosive fame of a few entrants. Beyond what they have built - most people build really awesome things - I have noticed a similarity to those who go on family..

Its really all about the narrative, the ability to put in words ( and stir the emotional space) with alluring pictures and anecdotes. To break into the field, you have to have a good combination of telling a good story. These guys are good engineers, but beyond being great at what they do, they are excellent orators and public speakers.

But how do we as mere mortals get to these stage? Well beyond attending hackathons which are not suitable for everyone - especially with a family. I suggest going to meet-ups and presenting on a topic. 

1. Set a target to do as many speaking engagements as possible - just like coding the more you do, the better you get.
2. Do a monthly review and assessment of your progress
3. Write every-day, thoughts and critics and what you have read. Do not necessarily make it public, journals have been a staple of our engineering diet for eons.
4. Do tutorials and training
5. Profit

Now, a lesson is nothing without exercise and practice, so go forth and multiply

This helps to build your narrative skills, as it breaks the anxiety barrier and lets you explore your creativity, thereby making a the world a better place.
