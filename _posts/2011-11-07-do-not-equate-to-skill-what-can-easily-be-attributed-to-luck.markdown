A post on a post about a post. How many layers of abstraction? Reminds me of paper money!

Do not really like linking to other posts - but this hits the nail on the head. The so called masters of the universe have no idea luck and serendipity plays such an important role in their 'achievements'. Much better analysis than can be done by me.

Excellent post by Fred Dustin on [hubris](http://freddestin.com/2011/11/ows-2-hubris-in-the-face-of-risk-and-a-culture-of-entitlement.html).
