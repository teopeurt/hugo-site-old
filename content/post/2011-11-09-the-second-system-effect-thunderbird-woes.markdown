title: The Second System Effect - Thunderbird Woes

My anecdotal evidence - Since 2005, there have been issues with Thunderbird speaking to IMAP servers, specifically saving messages to the sent folder. I assume there have been a bug filed for this but we are now in 2011 and this issue still exists in Thunderbird 7 - So much for progress.

<a title="Thunderbird Issue" href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=218625&amp;start=0." target="_blank">Issue Discussion Here:</a>

I really hate it when people point me to forums, as a source of a solution - especially ones that are 12 pages long! If you do not want to help, then don't reply! You do have a choice.

Anyway this reminds me of the highly charged jwz, who says it much better than me - even gave it a cool name -  <a title="CADT" href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT</a>.

Note that he was referring to Gnome 1 and 2, and now we have the monstrosity that is Gnome 3! So much for progress!

To al who says Google is your friend - the account settings are no longer under 'Tools'
they are now under 'Edit'.

Basically there are 2 things to do -

1. Reduce server connections cache to 1.


2. In 'copies and folders' under 'Account Settings', uncheck the box to automatically place copies in 'local' folders, rather have them stored in the server. The way IMAP works, you will still get these in your folders - go figure. Until they fix this issue, we will still have this problem!


Only link I found that gave me an idea on the folder thingy was by <a title="Dr Nabeel" href="http://nabtron.com/thunderbird-stuck-on-copying-message-to-sent-folder-solved-on-mac-osx/2909/" target="_blank">Dr Nabeel</a>

The reason for this post title? <a title="second system effect" href="The second-system effect refers to the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to have elephantine, feature-laden monstrosities as their successors. ">Wikipedia</a> is your friend!
