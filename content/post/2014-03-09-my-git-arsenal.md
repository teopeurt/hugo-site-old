I am a huge fan of [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and have been for many years. I tend to go through a lot of developer machines and thus will need to set up my dev environment really quickly - I only use Linux or Apple's Mac so a shell script normally works for me. Two invaluable tools I have come to love over the years is [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and [P4Merge](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools) by Perforce. As an aside Perforce is actually a proprietary version control system used in Enterprise but P4Merge is a free tool. 

One of the things everyone encounters when using Git are merge conflicts and this is where a visual tool is invaluable. I hate having to learn a new tool as my attention span is very limited and thus P4Merge does it for me. YMMV.

Sourcetree was an application originally developed for Mac OS X but was since acquired by Atlassian - owners of Bitbucket - so it has very good integration.

Git itself has a major learning curve but the investment is very much worth it. My advice is to take baby steps and don't try to get into the holy wars about branching models etc - e.g whether [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is good for you or not.
