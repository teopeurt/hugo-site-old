Today I am pleased to learn that [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) has been adopted/donated to the [Open API Initiative](https://openapis.org/), anyone who has worked with me on any project will know along with many "truths" I apply to any of my project, I always adopt an "API First Design" and use Swagger as a way to document the api. I find this approach works for cross-platform team and even remote ones as it enables back-end to get on with the task at hand without front-enders and mobile team hovering over

I recommended this approach when initial architecture designs for [HiHo](https://hiho.com) were taking place and we ended up  utilising the [Clojure Ring-Swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger) from day -1. I am happy to say that this decision was validated with the [other option](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/) dying off.

As an avid Linux User for over 10 years, the real number lies just double that, but don't ask my age! I am pleased to see that this initiative is supported and hosted by the ever present and exquisite [Linux Foundation](http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/).

I am currently working on a short book/tutorial on best practises on an API first approach, as there are many decisions which will come to haunt you if you take the wrong path and I have been stung many times in the past.
