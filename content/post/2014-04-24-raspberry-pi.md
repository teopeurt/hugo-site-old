As you may or may not know - I run [PigstyCoders](http://pigstycoders.com). It is a small yet global boutique with clients across 4 continents and 10 countries. We love and are active in the  open-source community and give back whenever possible, either through hackathons, workshops and giveaways.

I have always had a passion for Africa and it's potential and I think Africa is the next frontier in the digital evolution, hence why  are doing our best to enable local expertise, through workshops and talks. We don't just believe in copying over products from Europe and USA - but using our expertise to tailor the approach to the continent, especially those at the BOP.

It sounds like a crazy plan but we are planning in giving away 100 Raspberry Pi's across 10 African cities. Unlike other projects - this is not just a pump and dump mission. We are doing local workshops - backed with a live forum support and on-going discussion to help develop their skills further.

Who knows what will happen - just like open-source software - we just want to put this out there and see what happens.
