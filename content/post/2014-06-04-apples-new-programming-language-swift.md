title: Apple's New Programming Language Swift

Apple has just released a brand new programming language, I wont go
into any of the details as better men have already evaluated it.

My excitement is not on the language itself but rather the suite of
tools that comes with it. Quoting directly from the release notes.

* **Interactive.** Use Swift interactively to experiment with your ideas
  and see instant results.

* **Unified.** A complete replacement for both the C and Objective-C
  languages. Swift provides full object-oriented features, and
  includes low-level language primitives such as types, flow control,
  and operators

* **Playgrounds.** Playgrounds make writing Swift code productive and
easy. Type a line of code, and the result appears immediately.
If your code runs over time—for instance through a loop—you can add
that line of code to the Timeline Assistant to watch it progress.
Display variables in a graph, inspect each step of drawing a view, or
watch an animated Sprite

* **Kit scene.** When you’ve perfected your code in the playground, simply
move that code into your project. Some uses for playgrounds include:
Designing a new algorithm, watching its results every step of the way
Experimenting with new API or trying out new Swift syntax Creating new
tests and then verifying that they work before promoting them into your test suite

* **Learn in a playground**. Open select documentation in a playground to
  learn from the tutorial in an interactive environment. The
  combination of richly formatted documentation and interactive
  playground makes it easy to fully explore the API, changing and
  experimenting with the sample code.


* **Read-eval-print loop (REPL) in LLDB.** The debugging console in Xcode
includes an interactive version of the Swift language built right in.
Use Swift syntax to evaluate and interact with your running app, or
write new code to see how it works in a script-like environment. REPL
is available from within the Xcode console, or using LLDB from within
Terminal.

The reason this excites me is that now I can use similar tools which exists for Scala and of which I enjoy especially as a learning tool.
The playground feature reminds me of [scala worksheet](https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet/wiki/Getting-Started) but more powerful. That warrants its own post by the way.
I believe in experimentation and breaking things in order to learn and Apple has just won a new fan in me.
