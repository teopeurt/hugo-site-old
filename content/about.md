An opinionated polyglot, I do data, I do software, I do open-source, I love building
distributed, connected services, with mobiles.
development.

I sometimes teach Python using the Raspberry PI as a tool for pre-teen, teenagers and young adult from disadvantage backgrounds.

In my past life I used to work with software in high performance cars
[here](http://www.astonmartin.com/),
[here](http://www.jaguar.com/gb/en/) and [here](http://www.bmw.com/),
racing cars [here](http://www.mclaren.com/home/), regular cars
[here](http://www.ford.co.uk/).

I also tried to do something totally different in
[Computational Finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance),
realised that most of the theory was based on dodgy application of
Physics, so decided do my own research into analysing risk
and capital markets - similar in vein to
[Mandelbroit](http://www.amazon.com/The-behavior-Markets-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0465043550).

I also once tried to build a self-sustaining, self-healing network using [Village Telco](http://villagetelco.org).
