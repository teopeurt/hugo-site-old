I do data, I do software, I do open-source, I love building
distributed, connected services, hack embedded devices and mobile
development.
I also write software for mobiles, and try to make Web services
"reactive". I am also helping to build the open Web.

In my past life I used to work with software in high performance cars
[here](http://www.astonmartin.com/),
[here](http://www.jaguar.com/gb/en/) and [here](http://www.bmw.com/),
racing cars [here](http://www.mclaren.com/home/), regular cars
[here](http://www.ford.co.uk/), now I work with High Performance
Computers.


I tried to do something totally different in
[Computational Finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance),
realised that most of the theory was based on dodgy application of
Physics, so decided to fund and do my own research into analysing risk
and capital markets - similar in vein to
[Mandelbroit](http://www.amazon.com/The-behavior-Markets-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0465043550).
I am due to launch a product which demonstrates and blows Portfolio
Theory out of the water.

I am highly opinionated and think Africa's internet rate
penetration/adoption is NOT going quick enough. I intend to change
that hence why I support projects like the
[Village Telco](http://villagetelco.org). Unfortunately the stumbling
block is not technical.
