# Docker vs LXC/LXD

## what is Docker?

## What is LXC/LXD

## One against the other

Basically Docker is a commercial product backed by 95 million with an Open-source business model. Aside from it's structure and it's approach to "containers", its lack of private repo is the 1st reason I can use it. Well I can, but I dont want to pay them to host my images, it jsut seems to backwards. Here I am in control of my destiny right down to the metal and I go on to hand it over. 

Hence why my money is on LXD - heck even if Canonical were to go broke and disintegrate, the darn thing is written in the kernel, so no chance of obselensce and watching some prize go down the drain. 

SV has a habit of sunsetting perfectly great products just beacuse it doesnt quite make the billion dollars.
