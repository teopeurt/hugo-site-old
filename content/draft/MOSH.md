# MOSH

I have servers and systems on Azure, Amazon, Linode and DigitalOCean and many others. In addition ot migrating to something which I can easily use across systems, there is one constant - Mosh. 

It not only keeps a persistent connection to my boxes, it eliminates the ssh shell freeze when using dodgy internet providers in Africa - hence the "mobile" aspect of it. my only gripe is a lack of iOS client as my iPAd is much better device than my Android tablet [I will leave Android tablets out of this - thats another post]
