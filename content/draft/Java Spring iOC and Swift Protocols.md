# Java Spring iOC and Swift Protocols

They say nothing is new under the sun. As a multi-lingual programmer I find it interesting to see ideas being re-invented across different platforms and langauges. 

Java spring was hailed as a God send for the J2EE universe and righlty so  - it eliminated the nuisance and created a rather "happy" place for many Java enterprise programmers. The main cruft of it was iOC using DI to accomplish it. In practical terms, it was programming to interfaces/abstract classes. Decoupling was paramount. It was magic - and so simple.

This brought me to this article by Natasha the robot https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-2-0-protocol-oriented-mvvm/ - the concept of decoupling a system and creating extension - alas using protocols which is equivalent to Java interfaces.

Considering Swift and Java are both OO languages it stands to reason that one can break down the problem to the language agnostic term - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) - SOLID. This is the science/engineering aspect of programming which thoerist lament about but practitioners tend to shy away from. Ultimatley it makes you a better programmer as you will tend to know 'why' things are designed the way they are, and "how" to make your program design even more "beautiful" and robust.
