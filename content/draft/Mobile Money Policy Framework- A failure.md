# Mobile Money Policy Framework: A failure

Anecdotal evidence in Nigerian Landscape.

Two tier system from trying to solve the banking problem, those with the education, and means get a free account, merchant services with POS abilities etc.

It has been widely accepted that the solution to banking the unbanked, seems to be mobile money.

No merchant service, if I have to still have to pay in cash from my mobile wallet, what is the point?
No credit, loan or savings facility, 
No means of evaluating these different services
Agent led system, 
totally disconnected from the internet landscape, I cant pay for anyhting online

Closed systems, open-api to let the internet entrepenuers integrate,
