A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

### Header 3
> This is a blockquote.

> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.

This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

Pygments supports many languages, but doesn’t recognize some file extensions. Add lang:your_language to force highlighting if the filename doesn’t work.

{% codeblock Here's an example .rvmrc file. lang:ruby %}
rvm ruby-1.8.6 # ZOMG, seriously? We still use this version?
{% endcodeblock %}

Add an optional URL to enable downloading or linking to source.

{% codeblock Javascript Array Syntax lang:js http://j.mp/pPUUmW MDN Documentation %}
var arr1 = new Array(arrayLength);
var arr2 = new Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
{% endcodeblock %}
